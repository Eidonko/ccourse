# My Own Course About C!
This is a course about programming in the C programming language. It is _my own_ way of teaching C, meaning that it basically tells how _I_ program in C. I tried to explain this "from the very beginning", explaining some of the basic ideas too, though it will benefit from some previous experience with using a computer. In particular I assume people to have some idea of what a "memory" or a "CPU" is. In one place, I assume someone knows what a _register_ is actually :-)

The course has two major "special" ingredients:

- It explains how to create C _classes_. Yes, I mean classes in the sense of object orientation. Of course C is _not_ an object-oriented language, but in fact it offers many interesting features that can be used to create simple classes. The FILE type is indeed one such class; therefore I call this practice "the FILE methodology."
- It deals very much with _parsing_, the old fashioned way: many pages of this course are devoted to two classic tool for creating tool that parse context-free grammars: Lex and YACC (aka GNU/Flex and GNU/Bison).

Why special emphasys to the above ingredients? Well, because :-). Meaning, because those are the tools and concepts that I have been using more when programming in C.

Should you like to do so, submit your exercises / comments / questions to Eidon@tutanota.com -- I don't promise that I will answer _soon_, but I do promise I will answer :-)

Enjoy!

# Clarifications

- Note: Aim of this course is not to introduce OOP; only, to explain that one can use C in a "different", possibly sounder way. C is still used in several embedded products; some of these products deliver safety-critical services! I thought it was important to tell how I deal with managing complexity in C.
