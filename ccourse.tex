\begin{frame}[fragile]{CWEB and ``literate programming''}
``Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source
together in a fashion suited for reading by human beings [...]


\vspace{20pt}

In general, literate programs combine source and documentation
in a single file. Literate programming tools then parse the file
to produce either readable documentation or compilable source.


\vspace{20pt}

The WEB style of literate programming was created by D.E. Knuth during the development of
his \TeX{} typsetting software.

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{CWEB and ``literate programming''}

The WEB: ``The philosophy behind WEB is that an experienced system programmer,
who wants to provide the best possible documentation
of his or her software products, needs two things simultaneously:
a language like \TeX{} for formatting, and a language like C
for programming.


\vspace{20pt}

Neither type of language can provide the best
documentation by itself; but when both are appropriately
combined, we obtain a system that is much more useful than either language separately.

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{CWEB and ``literate programming''}
The structure of a software program may be thought of as a web
that is made up of many interconnected pieces.


\vspace{20pt}

To document
such a program we want to explain each individual part of the web
and how it relates to its neighbours.


\vspace{20pt}

The typographic tools
provided by \TeX{} give us an opportunity to explain the local
structure of each part by making that structure visible, and the
programming tools provided by languages such as C or Fortran make
it possible for us to specify the algorithms formally and
unambigously.


\vspace{20pt}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{CWEB and ``literate programming''}
By combining the two, we can develop a style
of programming that maximizes our ability to perceive the
structure of a complex piece of software, and at the same time
the documented programs can be mechanically translated into a
working software system that matches the documentation.''


\vspace{20pt}
